# Real time notifications

## Description

WebSockets to send real time notifications to the client.

This project is going to use SQL Server to store the data and the client will be notified when a new record is inserted in the database.
For the API, we are going to use `dotnet core web api` and for the client, we are going to use `React`.

## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is to learn how to use WebSockets and how to send real time notifications to the client.

Also, I might use this project as a base for future implementations in my current job.
